        Iâ€™m a French writer and content marketer living in Paris. Passionate about tech startup and SaaS, I work on a diverse range of projects to help company building their marketing strategy. I have been fortunate to work on a mix of local and global business during my career like AB Tasty, Shine, Alan, Comet, Spendesk, and Le Wagon.

        I started my career as Inbound Marketing Manager, during one year my objective was to generate leads and turn those leads into MQL. After this experience, I joined AB Tasty as Content Marketing Manager France for building a local content strategy. This project becomes my main freelancer mission for 2 years.
