        Hello! Iâ€™m a French UX Writer and Content Designer living in Paris. Passionate about design and copywriting, I help organizations create a clear and useful copy in product interfaces to help users reach a specific goal.

      <p>
        I started working as Content and Product Marketer for tech companies. From there, I develop solid writing skills and learn a lot about the product area and user needs. I turned my experience to help some SaaS and Tech companies provide awesome experiences for their users.

        I can help you leverage research, find consistency of messaging, grow your brand through better content, and scale up the role of content in your business.
